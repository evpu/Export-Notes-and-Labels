# Export variable Names, Labels and Notes to Excel

This script creates a codebook with variable names, their labels and notes that are associated with these variables.
This can be a handy tool when working with datasets that have a lot of descriptive information about variables.

Possible extensions:
The code can be easily modified to also export some summary statistics.
If needed, one can also write a .do file to export notes that are associated with the dataset as a whole.
